# JunctionManager
A tool for pushing folders from one drive to another seamlessly with junctions.

Instructions:
- Open the application shortcut in the start menu (search "Junction Manager") to configure where the folders are moved to on the secondary drive.
- Right click on a folder and click "Switch drives" to move it to the folder specified in the config, with sub directories matching where its saved on the main drive.
- Right click on a junction (even one not made by this tool, such as those made my SteamMover) and click "Switch drives" to move it back to the original folder location
